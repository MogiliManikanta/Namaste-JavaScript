What is Debouncing
What is Throttling
Difference between Debounce and Throttle functions
Web performance optimization by Debouncing
Rate limiting of function calls by Throttling
Example 1: How Search bar of ecommerce site uses Debouncing and Throttling
Example 2: Debouncing and Throttling effect on Resizing of Window
Example 3: Shooting Game scenario using throttling and Debouncing
Which is better Debouncing or Throttling
*/

/*Shooting game analogy:
Deboucing:  When the user clicks on the shoot button 10 times (Number of Bullets) Reload the gun for more shooting.
Throttle: When the user clicks on the shoot button, bullets runs out, but going to have to wait for the interval before it reloads by itsself


From JS engine's perspective
throttling: I am working on something which might take x milliseconds, so don't disturb me for next x milliseconds
debouncing: first you finish your action (typing, clicking) & then after x milliseconds I will fetch the required data



Throttling:
Baby: Mom give me a piece of chocolate cake
Mom: No you can get one, only after 1 hour
(baby wont get a piece of cake no matter how many times she asked, but only after each hour)

Debouncing:
Baby: Mom give me a piece of chocolate cake, . . .Mom give me a piece of chocolate cake ... mom give me ...
Mom: No, You will get a piece of cake only after 1 hour from LAST time you asked for one. ðŸ˜ƒ
